  uses: yuri-val/auto-pr-action@v1
  with:
    openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    openai_model: gpt-4o  # Optional, defaults to 'gpt-4o-mini'
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    dev_branch: dev  # Optional, defaults to 'dev'
```

Make sure to set up the `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret in your repository settings.

### Example Workflow Using Your Custom Action

Create a workflow file in your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/auto-pr.yml`):

```yml
name: Auto PR from dev to default

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  auto-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Auto PR Action
        uses: yuri-val/auto-pr-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
          dev_branch: 'dev'  # Optional, defaults to 'dev'

```

## How it works

1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Git configuration
3. Determines the default branch
4. Generates a diff between the dev and default branches
5. Uses OpenAI API to generate a descriptive PR content
6. Creates a new PR or updates an existing one
7. Adds relevant reviewers to the PR

## GitHub Workflow Description (Development Workflow)

### Branch Structure
1. Default Branch: `main` or `master`
2. Development Branch: `dev`
3. Feature Branches: Multiple branches like `feature/new_awesome_feature`, `feature/new_files`, etc.

### Workflow Steps

![alt text](docs/dev_workflow_steps.png)

1. **Branch Creation:**
   - The `dev` branch is created from the default branch (`main` or `master`).
   - `dev` always contains all commits from the default branch.

2. **Feature Development:**
   - Multiple feature branches are created from `dev`.
   - Examples: `feature/new_awesome_feature`, `feature/new_files`, etc.
   - Developers work on these feature branches.

3. **Feature Integration:**
   - When a feature is complete, it is merged into the `dev` branch.

4. **Automated Pull Request Creation/Update:**
   - On every merge to `dev` (or any push to `dev`):
     - An automated process creates or updates a Pull Request from `dev` to the default branch (`main` or `master`).
     - The Pull Request description is automatically generated using OpenAI's API.
     - This ensures that the default branch is always aware of changes in `dev`.

5. **Continuous Integration:**
   - The `dev` branch continuously integrates new features.
   - The automated PR to the default branch is kept up-to-date with these changes.

6. **Review and Merge:**
   - The auto-generated PR can be reviewed and eventually merged into the default branch when ready.

This workflow allows for organized feature development, continuous integration into the `dev` branch, and an always up-to-date PR to the default branch with AI-generated descriptions for easy review and merging.
